## About

Hi there, I'm Anatolij (or Tolik for short), a developer in training.

## ![Icon](https://returnnull.de/images/_64.png) SoG Savegame Reader 

This is an [editor](https://github.com/tolik518/SoG_SGreader) for the character files for [Secrets of Grindea](https://www.secretsofgrindea.com/). It's not full-featured but you can already open your save game, **export it as JSON** or **edit your name, money, skills, exp, inventory** and **most of what you want to edit!**   
Features like editing quest flags or collectibles are theoretically possible but were never finished.    
Nice-to-have features like importing save games from JSON or XML are also not implemented at the moment (v0.4.0).  
It was the only project I was close to finishing but scope creep and lack of knowledge of design patterns hindered me at that time to finalize the project. It's still being **maintained**.

This is a simple [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) game for the [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance). This version uses mode 3, which is also known as bitmap mode. It has no unusual limitations for the developer (except the limited resources of course) - so it was a nice way for me to get into C. It has not many features but it has a fancy title screen.

The **Qazaq Genius** project is a small website, that originated from an [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/qazaq.genius/), developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and PHP 8.1 with Slim for the backend.
The project was a personal initiative to contribute to the Qazaq community. By developing this website, the aim was to create a convenient platform for people to access the lyrics of the songs and to learn the Qazaq language. The website provides a valuable resource for music enthusiasts and language learners through collaboration and a passion for promoting Qazaq's cultural heritage.

Overall, the Qazaq Genius project is my appreciation for Qazaq culture, striving to bridge cultural gaps and foster a deeper understanding of the beauty and diversity of Qazaq culture through the power of music.

## SoG Savegame Reader ![Icon](https://returnnull.de/images/_64.png)

This is an [editor](https://github.com/tolik518/SoG_SGreader) for the character files for [Secrets of Grindea](https://www.secretsofgrindea.com/). Its not full-featured but you **can open your save game** and **edit your name, money, skills, exp, inventory** and **most of what you want to edit!**  
Features like editing quest flags or collectables are theoretically possible but were never finished. Nice-to-have features like exporting save games to JSON or XML are also not implemented at the moment (v0.3.8).
It was my only project I was close to finishing but scope creep and lack of knowledge of design patterns hindered me at that time to finilize the project.

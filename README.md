## ![Icon](https://returnnull.de/images/_64.png) SoG Savegame Reader

This is an editor for the character files of [Secrets of Grindea](https://www.secretsofgrindea.com/), a game I enjoyed playing. The SoG Savegame Reader allows you to open your save game, and edit various aspects such as your name, money, skills, experience, and inventory. You can also export the whole savegame to a JSON file. While some features like editing quest flags or collectibles are not implemented yet, I passively **maintain** the project but I don't plan to add more features at the moment (v0.4.0).

This is a simple Pong game developed for the Game Boy Advance using C. It utilizes mode 3, also known as bitmap mode, and features a cool title screen. Although it doesn't have many advanced features, it was a great project for me to dive into C programming and game development.

The **Qazaq Genius** project is a small website, that originated from an [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/qazaq.genius/), developed using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and PHP 8.1 with Slim for the backend.
The project was a personal initiative to contribute to the Qazaq community. By developing this website, the aim was to create a convenient platform for people to access the lyrics of the songs and to learn the Qazaq language. The website provides a valuable resource for music enthusiasts and language learners through collaboration and a passion for promoting Qazaq's cultural heritage.

Overall, the Qazaq Genius project is my appreciation for Qazaq culture, striving to bridge cultural gaps and foster a deeper understanding of the beauty and diversity of Qazaq culture through the power of music.

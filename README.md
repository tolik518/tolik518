# Projects

 Below are some of my repositories I've been working on. I tried to keep the selection as diverse as possible so you get a clearer picture what I'm into.

## ![Icon](https://returnnull.de/images/_64.png) SoG Savegame Editor

This is an editor for the character files of [Secrets of Grindea](https://www.secretsofgrindea.com/), an 2D action RPG. The SoG Savegame Reader, written in **C#**, it allows you to open your save game, and edit save data such as your name, money, skills, experience, inventory and much more. One can also export the whole savegame to a JSON file. While some features like editing quest flags or collectibles are not implemented yet, I passively **maintain** the project but I don't plan to add more features at the moment.  
Additionally to the UI, you can take a look at your savegame using the cli on linux and windows.

## ![Icon](https://returnnull.de/images/pong_github.png) GBA Pong

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolik518/GBA_Pong/master/.github/readme/pong-2.png" alt="Pong for Game Boy Advance" width="auto" height="auto" align="right">](https://github.com/tolik518/GBA_Pong)

This is a simple Pong game developed for the Game Boy Advance using **C**. It utilizes the mode 3, also known as bitmap mode, and features a cool pixel art title screen.   
Although it doesn't have any advanced features, it was a great project for me to dive into the C programming world, into dockerizing a C environment, and into game development.

## ![Icon](https://github.com/Qazaq-Genius/Qazaq-Genius-App/blob/editor/public/favicon-32x32.png) Qazaq Genius

The **Qazaq Genius** project is a small website, that originated from an [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/qazaq.genius/), developed using **Next.js** and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and **PHP 8.1** with Slim for the backend.
The project was a personal initiative to contribute to the Qazaq community. By developing this website, the aim was to create a convenient platform for people to access the lyrics of the songs and to learn the Qazaq language. The website provides a valuable resource for music enthusiasts and language learners through collaboration and a passion for promoting Qazaq's cultural heritage.

Overall, the Qazaq Genius project is my appreciation for Qazaq culture, striving to bridge cultural gaps and foster a deeper understanding of the beauty and diversity of Qazaq culture.

## ![bitmap_type_tracer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tolik518/bitmap_type_tracer/main/logo.png)

bitmap_type_tracer is a CLI tool, to generate text-images from bitmaps-font, I wrote in an effort to get into the **Rust** ecosystem.  
It takes the bitmap-font and the text you want to write as input and generates an image with the provided text and the provided bitmap font.

 A reddit bot, written in **Rust**, replying to comments, containing factorials, with the solution. This little fella is currently running on r/mathmemes and r/unexpectedfactorial - additionally to that it can be summoned on every subreddit.

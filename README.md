## About

Hi, I'm living and working from Berlin and currently visiting a school providing vocational education.

## SoG Savegame Reader ![Icon](https://returnnull.de/images/_64.png)

This is an [editor](https://github.com/tolik518/SoG_SGreader) for the character files for [Secrets of Grindea](https://www.secretsofgrindea.com/). Its not full-featured but you can already open your save game, **export it as JSON** or **edit your name, money, skills, exp, inventory** and **most of what you want to edit!**   
Features like editing quest flags or collectables are theoretically possible but were never finished.    
Nice-to-have features like importing save games from JSON or XML are also not implemented at the moment (v0.4.0).  
It was my only project I was close to finishing but scope creep and lack of knowledge of design patterns hindered me at that time to finilize the project. It's still being **maintained**.

## Gather 518% ![Icon](https://returnnull.de/images/GT32.png)

[Gather 518%](https://github.com/tolik518/gather_518/) is a google chrome extension that adds some menu points to the [gather.town](gather.town) UI.  
This is a work in progress proof on concept and is in the very early stages.


### Plan (not everything implemented yet): 
- Teleport to user
- Get users to you
- Make yourself a robot (other can control you through chat commands e.g. `up 2`, `left 4`, `down 1`)
- UI elements in the online section
- Publish to the Chrome Web Store
